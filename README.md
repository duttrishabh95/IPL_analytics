# IPL_analytics
This repo uses mainly the yorkr and many other packages with the aim to provide a consolidated platform to analyse IPL, ball by ball data.

The data files are from Cricsheet in YAML format. This
archive contains 756 Indian Premier League matches.

The primary objective of this package is to convert ball by ball IPL match data which is in YAML format to CSV, hassle free.

There are primarily 4 clasees of functions, where each serves a unique purpose. Further details can be found withing the code files with pre-fit exmaples as the code is well commented.

Also, my aim is to lay a groundwork for data based analysis in cricket, as is done in other sports over the period of time. With the repo you shall also witness a word document where some scenarios thought by me, have beeen tried to answer via data backed analysis from the coode in this repository.

Enjoy!
